## What is Agile?
- Build in modules.
- Start delivering after quick interval called Sprints.
  - E.g: Deploy a website
    - Deliver Homepage in 1st Sprint which could be two weeks.
    - Deliver Category page in 2nd sprint in next two weeks.
    - Deliver features in 3rd sprint in next two weeks.
- Keep it simple and build the minimum that needs to be deliver which satisfies the basic requirements
- MVP: Minimum Viable Product.
- It's a methodology that delivers the product or value incrementally from the start of the project instead of all at once at the end.
- It is iterative and time boxed.

## How is it different?
- Analysis in every sprint
- Design
- Code
- Testing from the beginning

## Agile principles
- Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of useful software.
- Simplicity - only build what is really essential
- Self-organizing teams 
- Regular adaption to changing circumstances
- Working software is delivered frequently
- The Agile Manifesto was published by a small group of developers in 2001

## Key concepts
- User stories: As a user I want to do this so that...
- Story points: Relative unit of measure to assess whether a user story is big or small where 5 means high complexity and 2 mean low complexity
- Product backlog: All the stories but tangible and flexible
- Sprint backlog: Couple of stories that needs to be worked on given time frame( 2 weeks).
- Velocity: Number of story points delivered over a sprint.
- Swimlanes: Visual representation of stories (y axis) vs status on the kanban/agile board (To do, doing, done)
- MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and not most valuable player 
  - Bare minimum product that meets the client's expectations. 
  - Includes all must have and excludes all nice to haves. 
- Release: Comprised of several iteration or sprints.
- Sprints: Period of time in which the team will work on defined set of user stories.

## Agile team and Roles
- Product owner: Represents the end customer.
- Scrum Master: Facilitates team meetings, removes team impediments, liaises with the product owner and ensures the team remains on track.
- Delivery (Development team)
