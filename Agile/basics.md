## What is Agile?
- Build in modules.
- Start delivering after quick interval called Sprints.
  - E.g: Deploy a website
    - Deliver Homepage in 1st Sprint which could be two weeks.
    - Deliver Category page in 2nd sprint in next two weeks.
    - Deliver features in 3rd sprint in next two weeks.
- Keep it simple and build the minimum that needs to be deliver which satisfies the basic requirements
- MVP: Minimum Viable Product.
- It's a methodology that delivers the product or value incrementally from the start of the project instead of all at once at the end.
- It is iterative and time boxed.
