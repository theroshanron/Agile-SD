### If you find a bug in the production, how to make sure that the same bug is not introduced again?
- We will do the regression testing to make sure that same bug does not occur and can add automation testing.

### What do you when the developer denies that you filed is a bug?
- Provide business documentation reference to support why existing functionality is not per the design.
- Involve product owner/ Business analyst.
- If Bug is not reproducible then provide the screenshots of the bug, give timestamp.
- Provide test data used for replicating the issue.

### What has been one of the greatest challenges while doing regression testing
- Test data issue.
- Improper selection of regression test cases might skip a major regression defect to be found.

### Difference between functional testing and non-functional testing
- Functional testing verifies that features/system working as expected according to requirements.
- Non-functional requirements tells how well the system does it within design and resources constrainment.

### Enlist some of the key challenges that are faced while performing software testing.
- Data issues.
- Environment available.
