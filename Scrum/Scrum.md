## Introduction to a Scrum 
- Iterative and incremental development. 
- Birth of Agile happened with four values and twelve principles followed by Agile Alliance in 2002
- Built on the lean principles where lean software development is subset of Agile development
- A framework for team to work in a highly efficient and sustainable manner
- Agile software development got replaced by agile product development to denote it's benefit are applicable to many groups.
  - Research and identify viable markets, technologies, and prdouct capabilities
  - Develop products and enancements
  - Release projects and enancements, as frequently as many times per day
  - Develop and sustain Cloud and other operational environment 
  - To sustain and renew products 
- Scrum is now being used beyond products and even in managing the operation of organisations and almost everything we use in our daily lives, as individuals and societies.

## Empirical Process Control
- Active changing of a process based on the results of the process monitoring
- Supported by the  
  - Transparency:
    - Significant aspects of the process are visible to those who are responsible for the outcome 
    - Define a common standard so that all observes have a common understanding
  - Inspection:
    - Process and artifacts are inspected regularly
    - Performed by skilled inspectors at the point of work 
  - Adaption: 
    - Continuous Improvement based on the feedback
    - Make the adustment as soon as possible when needed.

## Scrum values
- Commitment: Personally
- Courage
- Focus: On team's goal
- Respect: Respect feedback and opinion
- Openness: Open about all the work and challenges

## Waterfall model
- Sequentially to solve a complex problem.
- Linear sequential design approach
  - Requirement
  - Analysis
  - Design
  - Build
  - Test
  - Deploy
  - Maintain
- Structural approach leading from stage to stage
- Low maturity framework
- Top down, low autonomy model with the actual team 
- Iterative: Repeat the process again to improve
  - Incremental: Adding to the product in a series of small changes
    - Transparency
      - Inspection
        - Adaption

## What is Scrum?
- A framework for developing, delivering, sustaining complex products
- It's lightweight, simple to understand and difficult to master
- It allows to understand the effectiveness of the product management and work techniques to continuously improve the product 
- It is not a process, technique or definitive method 
- Consist of framework design
  - Product Backlog
    - Involves leadership, customers, stakeholders and users input owned by product owners (managers)
    - Sprint is the timeline for the product development
      - Sprint planning occurs daily,weekly or bi-weekly to discuss the goal, achievement and challenges
      - Sprint review to check the done items and future direction with high level agreement 
      - Sprint retrospective to check what went well and what can be improved 
    - Potentiall shippable / deliverable product
- Product owners 
  - Development team
    - Scrum master
  
## Scrum Roles
- Product owner: Has responsibility for the product value
    - Maximise the value of the product 
    - Value means efficienc, quality
    - Sole responsibility to manage the product log and delegate 
    - Ordering items to best achieve goals
    - Optimizing the value of work the dev team performs
    - Balance all views from inside and outside the scrum team
- Scrum master: Has responsibility for the process that team follows scrum and agile methodology
  - A unique role for someone with expertise in scrum.
  - Promoting and supporting scrum
  - Helping everyone understand scrum theory, practices, rules and values.
  - Clearing obstacles and establishing an effective environment
  - Addressing team dynamics and protecting the team from outside influence
  - Need to work together with the product owner 
  - Finding techniques for effective product backlog management
  - Understanding product planning in an empirical environment
  - Understanding and practicing agility
  - Protector, Advisor, Facilitator and teacher to focus on the process
  - Help the development team to create high value products
- Development team: Has responsibility for the delivery and development of the product
  - Deliver the potentially releasable increment of done product at the end of each sprint
  - Self organizing and cross functional
  - No titles and sub-teams within the team 
  - Accountability belongs to the team
  - Development team size should be minimal following the Amazon rule of feed the team with two pizzas
    - Fewer than 9 and more than 3 should be optimal
- All members are self organized and cross functional

## Scrum Events
- Scrum events are to create regularity and to minimise the need for meetings not defined in Scrum.
- It is needed to enable the transparency, inspection and adaption.
- Five events:
  - Sprint
    - Usable and deliverable product creation.
    - A goal of what is to be built, a design, a flexible plan, the actual work and product increment.
    - Everyone is involved in the sprint including the stakeholders
    - Time box for maximum of one month but not fixed and only on agreable timeline.
    - No changes can be made that would endanger the goal.
    - Scope is clarified and renegotiated between PO and dev team.
    - If the sprint goal becomes obsolete due to company's direction change or market tech condition changes, cancel the spint after reviweing the releasable work.
  - Sprint planning 
    - Scrum team attends the session to focus on planning of the work 
    - What can be delivered and how will the work be achieved?
    - Eight hours per month usually 2 hours per week. 
    - Defined the sprint goal and latest product increment. 
    - Projected capacity of the team and review past performance of the dev team to look at the best indicator.
    - Draw up an inital plan to achieve the goal within sprint period. 
    - Convert product backlog into a working incrmeent by working together to design the system.
    - Sprint Goal: 
      - An objective set for the sprint to provide guidance on what functionalities to be build with focus in mind. 
  - Daily Scrum
    - Internal meeting for the dev team where product owner and scrum market have options to join or not.
    - Scheduled daily on same time for 15 mins.
    - To inspect the progress and plan the next 24 hours
    - Optimises collaboration and performance of the team 
    - Eliminates the need of other meeting.
    - Answer three questions:   
      - What did I do yesterday?
      - What will i do today?
      - Are there any impediments in my way?
  - Sprint retrospective
  - Sprint Review
    - It is for the whole scrum team and product owner decides which other stakeholders to invite.
    - 4 hours in a month / 1 hour weekly.
    - Inspect the sprint increment and make a decision whether to accept or not the so far development from last review.
    - Opportunity to understand and discuss what was done during the sprint and collaborate on what could be done in the next sprint to optimize value.
    - Product owner explaining what has been done and has not .
    - The development team will demo the work done and answer questions on the increment.
    - Revised backlog
